# ChainScore

## Overview

**ChainScore** is a blockchain-based trust scoring platform designed to facilitate transparent and secure business-to-business (B2B) transactions. Built on the **Linea** network and leveraging **MetaMask** for wallet interactions, ChainScore empowers entities to establish trust through on-chain verification of their payment histories and contractual commitments. The platform uses smart contracts deployed on the Linea network, which ensure that all agreements and payment histories are immutable and accessible to relevant parties.

ChainScore’s trust scores serve as a reliable measure of an entity’s credibility based on its historical payment behavior, contract fulfillment, and peer ratings. Businesses can confidently engage with one another, knowing that the trust scores are securely maintained and transparent.

## Deployed Contract Addresses

ChainScore’s smart contracts are deployed on the **Linea** blockchain. The following are the contract addresses for interacting with the platform:

- **Trust Score Contract**: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`
- **Payment Verification Contract**: `0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12`

## MetaMask Integration

To interact with ChainScore’s smart contracts, users need to integrate with **MetaMask**. Follow these steps:

1. **Install MetaMask**: If you haven't already, install the MetaMask extension for your browser from [MetaMask's official website](https://metamask.io/).
2. **Connect to MetaMask**: Open MetaMask and connect it to the appropriate network (Linea).
3. **Interact with Contracts**: Use the deployed contract addresses to interact with ChainScore’s smart contracts directly from your dApp or through MetaMask's interface.
